This has brought me to where I am today, where I have currently over 20.000 screenshots of the game </p> <p> In the past I already did a smaller project, when I had reached the 10.000 screenshots milestone. Which involved taking all the screenshots I had at the time, and using them to recreate one single picture. The result was a <a href="%27./%27/img/SkyMosaic.jpg" target="_blank">a beautiful mosaic.</a> (Try to zoom in, to see the individual screenshots) </p> <p> Apart from the 20.000 screenshots milestone, I was also interested in my overal playtime over the years. Since Sky unfortunately doesn't have an in game timer, which shows your overal playtime. I decided to create something that tries to calculate that. <br> Although it will be an average, and won't account for the times you didn't take any screenshots. It should still give a rough estimate of how many hours you have poured into this gem of a game! </p> <h1> Other </h1> <p> The source code for this website can be found <a href="">here!</a> </p> <p> Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/steveschoger" target="_blank">Steve Schoger</a> for his <a href="https://heroicons.dev/" target="_blank">Hero</a> icons! </p> </div> <div class="bottomnav"> <p> Made by <a href="https://jam53.github.io/jam54/about">jam54</a>.
