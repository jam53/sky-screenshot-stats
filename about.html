        <em>Sky Screenshot Stats</em>
        is a website that gives you an insight in your Sky playtime & some other statistics.
        This is achieved by analyzing the date at which your screenshots were taken.
        It is your device that processes the data, nothing is sent to any server!

    <p>
        The creation date based on which the statistics are calculated, is retrieved by one of the following 2 ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The program first looks to the pictures' file names, to see if these contain the creation date.</li>
        <li>If the file name doesn't contain a valid date, then the program looks to the creation date of the file, inside the file's properties.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>
            Note: Sometimes the creation date of a file gets overwritten in the file's properties.
            For example when you open the image, make changes to it and save it.
            In this that file is no longer valid.
        </p>
        <p>
            In such cases, if neither the creation date in the properties of the file is valid, nor the file name contains a valid date.
            <br>
            The file will be ignored, and won't be used to generate the statistics.
            The page that displays the statistics, also has a metric that shows how many files were processed, and how many were invalid.
        </p>
