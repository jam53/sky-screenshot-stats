        <p>
            I originally started playing <a href="https://www.thatskygame.com/" target="_blank">Sky: Children Of The Light</a>
            on April 7th, 2020.
            <br>
            Since then I have taken a lot of pictures, of almost anything that I found either beautiful, interesting or worth to remember inside the game!
            This has brought me to where I am today, where I have currently over 20.000 screenshots of the game
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past I already did a smaller project, when I had reached the 10.000 screenshots milestone.
            Which involved taking all the screenshots I had at the time, and using them to recreate one single picture.
            The result was <a href="./img/SkyMosaic.jpg" target="_blank">a beautiful mosaic.</a>
            (Try to zoom in, to see the individual screenshots)
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from the 20.000 screenshots milestone, I was also interested in my overal playtime over the years.
            Since Sky unfortunately doesn't have an in game timer, which shows your overal playtime.
            I decided to create something that tries to calculate that.
            <br>
            Although it will be an average, and won't account for the times you didn't take any screenshots.
            It should still give a rough estimate of how many hours you have poured into this gem of a game!
