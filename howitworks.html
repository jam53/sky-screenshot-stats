These dates can then be used to generate some statistics. This data is retrieved by one of the following 2 ways: </p> <ul> <li>The program first looks to the pictures' file names, to see if these contain the creation date.</li> <li>If the file name doesn't contain a valid date, then the program looks to the last modified date of the file, inside the file's properties.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p> Note: Sometimes the last modified date of a file gets overwritten inside the file's properties, thus causing it to become invalid. <br> One example of where this might happen, is when the user opens the image, makes changes to it and saves it. Or sometimes even by just moving the file to another location. </p> </blockquote> <br> <h1>What happens when it isn't possible to retrieve a valid date for a screenshot?</h1> <p> In such cases, where neither the creation date in the properties of the file is valid, nor the file name contains a valid date. </p> <p> The file will be ignored, and won't be used to generate the statistics. The page that displays the statistics, also has a metric that shows how many files were processed, and how many were invalid. </p> </div> <div class="bottomnav"> <p> Made by <a href="https://jam53.github.io/jam54/about" target="_blank">jam54</a>.
